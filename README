#  Pneumonia can be caused by a variety of organisms. In 2018, 1.3 million people were diagnosed, and 47,956 people died due to pneumonia[i]. 
The numbers have only increased since 2019 due to the novel coronavirus[ii]. Pneumonia evaluation primarily includes chest x-ray diagnosis by a radiologist. 
This diagnosis is complex and there is a need to improve the accuracy and speed. 
To find a quicker alternative, I have designed a python-based machine learning algorithm to diagnose pneumonia in silico from chest x-ray images.
My algorithm uses a convolutional neural network, and my datasets are downloaded from an open- source repository called Kaggle. 
My project includes identification of parameters to improve accuracy, and evaluation of different datasets and image types. 
I found that processing images in RGB scale results in higher prediction accuracy, and I was successfully able to categorize images into normal or pneumonia with an accuracy of 93% and a loss of 15%. 
My algorithm was also successful in categorizing chest x-ray images into COVID-19 related or non-related pneumonias with an accuracy of 87% and a loss of 18%.
I hope that my algorithm will be able to help reduce the worldwide mortality rates, even to a small extent, in high-risk patients.
